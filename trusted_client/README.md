Inpsect HTML source of website, we see that the logic to check username, password is written inside HTML code. No remote validation required
The JS client code is written in [JSFuck](http://www.jsfuck.com/)
You dont need to decode the JSFuck, as I found no decoder that work reliably. Just using nodejs `node jsfuck.js`, JS interpreter will decode it and throw you back the original source code.
